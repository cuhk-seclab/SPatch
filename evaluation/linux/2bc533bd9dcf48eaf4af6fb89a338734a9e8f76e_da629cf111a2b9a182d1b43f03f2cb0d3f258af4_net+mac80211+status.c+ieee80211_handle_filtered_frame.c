	 *  (1) STA sends frame indicating it will go to sleep and does so
	 *  (2) hardware/firmware adds STA to filter list, passes frame up
	 *  (3) hardware/firmware processes TX fifo and suppresses a frame
	 *  (4) we get TX status before having processed the frame and
	 *	knowing that the STA has gone to sleep.
	 *
	 * This is actually quite unlikely even when both those events are
	 * processed from interrupts coming in quickly after one another or
	 * even at the same time because we queue both TX status events and
	 * RX frames to be processed by a tasklet and process them in the
	 * same order that they were received or TX status last. Hence, there
	 * is no race as long as the frame RX is processed before the next TX
	 * status, which drivers can ensure, see below.
	 *
	 * Note that this can only happen if the hardware or firmware can
	 * actually add STAs to the filter list, if this is done by the
	 * driver in response to set_tim() (which will only reduce the race
	 * this whole filtering tries to solve, not completely solve it)
	 * this situation cannot happen.
	 *
	 * To completely solve this race drivers need to make sure that they
	 *  (a) don't mix the irq-safe/not irq-safe TX status/RX processing
	 *	functions and
	 *  (b) always process RX events before TX status events if ordering
	 *      can be unknown, for example with different interrupt status
	 *	bits.
	 *  (c) if PS mode transitions are manual (i.e. the flag
	 *      %IEEE80211_HW_AP_LINK_PS is set), always process PS state
	 *      changes before calling TX status events if ordering can be
	 *	unknown.
